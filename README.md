# Data-Structures-and-Algorithms-Assignments
This repository contains the assignments completed as a part of the coursework for the course Data Structures and Algorithms. 

# Assignment 1
These assignments test the ability to implement algorithms and further analyze them. 
  Stack Used:
  The Algorithms have been implemented in Python.
  Numpy and Matplotlib were used for the visualization of the results of these algorithms.
